			<p>Hi! My name is Ty.
			</p>
			<p>I'm studying to be a web developer. I have an associate degree
				in computer science and worked in IT support for the last three years.
				 I like the creativity and problem-solving that is involved with web development so 
				 I started self-teaching over the past year.
			</p>
			<p>
				In my free time I like playing video games, reading and creating digital artwork. 
				I'm married and live in Somerdale, NJ.
